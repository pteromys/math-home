Old math homepage
=================

This is the homepage I used to have at math.uchicago.edu.
([See it in action](https://pteromys.melonisland.net/math-home/).)

It's saved here mostly in case future math grad students wanted to use it as a
starting point for an academic webpage. The main features are:

1. It's pretty.
2. When printed, it rearranges itself into a reasonable approximation of a CV.

It's released under the [UNLICENSE](./UNLICENSE), to keep it easy to adapt and
remix.
